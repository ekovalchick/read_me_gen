  ## Description
  
 This project allows the user to creat a 3 letter SVG logo generator. 
The user will br prompted with lists and written responses in the terminal to design the logo.
After the user selects the desired design, a new svg file will be created with the logo.
The biggest lesson I learned from this is how to create a test using node jest. 
I created this app to test my knowledge on node.JS and understand how to create tests.
